# Netflix Movies and TV Shows EDA: Uncovering User Preferences

## Overview
This project is centered around conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix's movies and TV shows. By diving deep into various data points and features, we aim to uncover patterns and insights related to user preferences and behavior on the Netflix platform. This information could be valuable for content recommendations and curation.

Netflix isn't just a streaming platform; it's a universe of content. As of mid-2021, the platform offers over 8,000 movies and TV shows, catering to a global audience exceeding 200 million subscribers. Our dataset captures this diversity in a tabular format, detailing each title's cast, director, rating, release year, and more.

## Methodology
1. **Data Wrangling**: Initial cleanup and transformation of the raw Netflix dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilizing statistical tools to explore, summarize, and visualize the data.
3. **Insight Generation**: Deriving insights that could inform Netflix's content curation and recommendations.

## Key Features
- In-depth examination of titles, genres, and other metadata.
- Statistical analyses to identify user preferences and viewing habits.
